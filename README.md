# DBF-CSV-2-JSON
Simple program that converts CSV files to JSON files and converts simple BDF files to JSON/CSV as well.

Can almost always convert CSV files flawlessly. Can have a little trouble handling large BDF files though.

NOTE:
  In order to have this program work you must go into the "DBF.py" file (that is imported) and change the line 
  "ignore_missing_memofile=False" to "ignore_missing_memofile=True".
