# DBF-CSV-2-JSON
Single-file program that converts DBF files to JSON files and converts CSV files to JSON as well.

NOTE:
  In order to have this program work you must go into the "DBF.py" file (that is imported) and change the line 
  "ignore_missing_memofile=False" to "ignore_missing_memofile=True".
